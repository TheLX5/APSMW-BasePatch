# Archipelago's Super Mario World Base Patch
This repository contains all the static ASM that's used to implement SMW in [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago).

File/folder structure AND readme are subject to change.

## Build
No instructions yet. It will use [Asar 1.90](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar/releases/tag/v1.90) though.
